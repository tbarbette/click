 * Strip the TCP header from front of packets
 * =d
 * Removes all bytes from the beginning of the packet up to the end of the TCP header.
 * It will also increase an annotation (by default Paint2) by the number of bytes poped
 * to remember how long was the header and allow to revert the operation later. This is
 * intended to be used with UnstripAnno
 * =e
 * Use this to get rid of all headers up to the end of the TCP layer, print the HTTP request payload, and
 * go back to the previous pointer:
 *
 *   s :: Search("\r\n\r\n") //Strips to the end of the pattern
 *   -> Print("HTTP REQUEST PAYLOAD") //So Print will show the content
 *   -> UnstripAnno(); //Go back to where we were
 *
 *   s[1] -> Print("Malformed HTTP");
